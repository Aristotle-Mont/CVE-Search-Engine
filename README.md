## Introduction

This project focuses on indexing and searching Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data using Elasticsearch. The data is enriched using BERT-based embeddings to enable semantic search. The project covers:

1. Connecting to Elasticsearch
2. Preparing the CVE data
3. Creating vector representations of the data
4. Indexing the data into Elasticsearch
5. Performing semantic search queries

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Elasticsearch**: 8.0+
- **BERT Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2

### Installation

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

The CVE data is read from a CSV file and preprocessed to fill missing values. The data is then converted into dictionary format for easier indexing into Elasticsearch.

## Vectorization

The project uses the `sentence-transformers` library to generate BERT-based embeddings for the `summary` field of each CVE record. These embeddings are stored as vectors for semantic search.

## Indexing Data

### Connecting to Elasticsearch

The project connects to an Elasticsearch instance using basic authentication and specifies the certificate authority for secure communication.

### Creating an Index

The project creates an index with specific mappings to accommodate the CVE data structure. If an index already exists, it is deleted before creating a new one.

### Inserting Data

The project inserts the CVE records into the index, formatting the dates and logging any errors encountered during the process.

## Searching Data

### Semantic Search

The project performs semantic search using the vector representation of input keywords and compares it against the `summaryVector` field in the Elasticsearch index. The search results are then displayed.

### Text Search

The project also includes a function for simple text-based searches using the `summary` field.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- **Python**: 3.7+
- **Elasticsearch**: `pip install elasticsearch`
- **Sentence Transformers**: `pip install sentence-transformers`
- **Pandas**: `pip install pandas`
- **Matplotlib**: `pip install matplotlib`

Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for detailed dependencies.
